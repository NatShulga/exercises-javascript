Here are three constants with different people's names. Make up and print a word out of the characters in this order:

1. The third character from the first line.
2. The second character from the second line.
3. The fourth character from the third line.
4. The fifth character from the second line.
5. The third character from the second line.

Try using interpolation: you can put individual characters (called via square brackets) inside curly brackets, as well as variables.
