Write the `filterString()` function that takes a string and a character as input and returns a new string, from which all occurrences of the character are removed.

```javascript
const str = 'If I look back I am lost';
filterString(str, 'I'); // 'f  look back  am lost'
filterString('zz Zorro', 'z'); // ' Zorro'
```
