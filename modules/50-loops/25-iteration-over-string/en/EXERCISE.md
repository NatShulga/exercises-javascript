Write the `printReversedWordBySymbol()` function that takes a word as input and prints it by character, just as in the example we gave, but does it in reverse order.

```javascript
const word = 'Hexlet';

printReversedWordBySymbol(word);
// => 't'
// => 'e'
// => 'l'
// => 'x'
// => 'e'
// => 'H'
```
