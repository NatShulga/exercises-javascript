In JavaScript you can "query" and print any ASCII character. For example:

```javascript
console.log(String.fromCharCode(63));
```

Character 63 will be printed - a question mark. You can print any character this way.

Find an ASCII table on the internet. You can use queries like "ASCII codes table" or "ASCII codes". Generally, these tables give codes in several number systems: decimal, binary, octal and hexadecimal. We are interested in the decimal code (*dec* or *decimal*).

Using the example above and the table you found, print the characters `~`, `^` and `%` (each on their own line).

(Of course, you could cheat and just do something like `console.log('~')`, but that would be no fun at all :)
